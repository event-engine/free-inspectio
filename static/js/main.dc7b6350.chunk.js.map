We switched the rendering engine to make use of native browser SVG transformations. This means, you can put much more stickies on the board, even without grouping them in Bounded Contexts and Features. The extra performance boost allowed us to increase the details zoom factor. When zooming out you'll longer see all details. In a future version it will also be possible to disable the fade out effect completely.</p>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Auto Scrolling\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>When moving or connecting elements near the screen border, the board is automatically scrolled in the direction.
